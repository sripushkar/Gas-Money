# Gas Money
Basic calculator to see how much people owe you when you drive them. The current gas prices and your car's fuel economy are automatically found(except in a few cases).<br/>
You will need the following Python modules installed:
* requests
* xml<br/>

You can install these using pip3 if you don't have them.

The data for the gas prices and the fuel economy is sourced from the following API:
https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/ws/

This may not be completely accurate since this uses the national gas price average, and the price in your area might vary.
